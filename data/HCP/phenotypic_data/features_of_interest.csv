NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Executive Function/Cognitive Flexibility (Dimensional Change Card Sort),CardSort_Unadj,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. It is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time.

Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of perceived rejection and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of perceived rejection. "
NIH Toolbox Emotional Support Survey: Unadjusted Scale Score,Emotion,"Social Relationships (Social Support, Companionship, Social Distress, Positive Social Development)",EmotSupp_Unadj,"This self-report measure assesses emotional support (refers to the perception that people in one’s social network are available to listen to one’s problems with empathy, caring and understanding) through an 8-item fixed-length form for ages 18-85. The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. Higher scores are indicative of more emotional support. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of support,and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of support."

The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. higher scores are indicative of more reported support. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of instrumental supportand scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of instrumental support."

The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. Higher scores are indicative of more perceived stress. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of perceived stress and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of perceived stress."
NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy Survey: Unadjusted Scale Score,Emotion,"Stress and Self Efficacy (Perceived Stress, Self-Efficacy)",SelfEff_Unadj,"This is a self-report measure administered to ages 8-85 in CAT form. It assesses respondents' sense of global self-efficacy (a person’s belief in his/her capacity to manage functioning and have control over meaningful events). The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. Higher scores are indicative of more general self-efficacy. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of general self-efficacy and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of general self-efficacy."

NIH Toolbox 9-hole Pegboard Dexterity Test : Unadjusted Scale Score,Motor,Dexterity (9-hole Pegboard),Dexterity_Unadj,"This test of manual dexterity records the time required for the participant to accurately place and remove 9 plastic pegs into a plastic pegboard. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average. Higher scoring is indicative of better dexterity in the dominant hand. For the 9-Hole Pegboard Dexterity Test, the raw score, recorded as time in seconds that it takes the participant to complete the task, is commonly used for interpretation, with faster completion times (less time to complete) representing better manual dexterity. This also allows for raw comparisons between dominant and non-dominant hand performance. Raw scores are available on request to info@humanconnectome.org. However, one can also evaluate performance with the dominant hand by looking at the normative scale scores provided here."
