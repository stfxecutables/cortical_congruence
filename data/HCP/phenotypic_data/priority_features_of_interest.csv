NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Executive Function/Cognitive Flexibility (Dimensional Change Card Sort),CardSort_AgeAdj,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. DCCS is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. "
NIH Toolbox Cognition Crystallized Composite: Age Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Cognition Crystallized Composite,CogCrystalComp_AgeAdj,"The Crystallized Cognition Composite score is derived by averaging the normalized scores of each of the Toolbox tests that are crystallized measures (Picture Vocabulary and Reading Tests), then deriving scale scores based on this new distribution. One can interpret the Crystallized Cognition Composite as a more global assessment of individual and group verbal reasoning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of functioning. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."

The Early Childhood Composite Score can be interpreted much like the Cognitive Function Composite and it provides a highly reliable overall snapshot of general cognitive functioning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of functioning. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."

One can interpret the Fluid Cognition Composite as a more global assessment of individual and group fluid cognition functioning. Higher scores indicate higher levels of functioning. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."

Delay Discounting: Area Under the Curve for Discounting of $200 (DDisc_AUC_200),Cognition,Self-regulation/Impulsivity (Delay Discounting),DDisc_AUC_200,"Delay Discounting: Area Under the Curve (AUC) for Discounting of $200. A summary measure of Delay Discounting, the AUC discounting measure provides an index of how steeply the participant discounts a delayed reward of $200 (Myerson et al. 2001). Delay discounting describes the undervaluing of rewards that are delayed in time. It is illustrated by the fact that humans (and other animals) will often choose a smaller immediate reward over an objectively larger, but delayed reward. "

NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Executive Function/Inhibition (Flanker Task),Flanker_AgeAdj,"The Flanker is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention for ages 3-85. It is considered a fluid ability measure (i.e. measures the capacity for new learning and information processing in novel situations) in which performance reaches a peak in early adulthood, then tends to decline across the life span. The test requires the participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows for ages 8-85) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the flankers (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."

The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. Higher scores are indicative of more general life satisfaction. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of general life satisfaction and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of general life satisfaction."

It is considered a “fluid ability” measure, with performance tending to peak in early adulthood and then declining across the life span. Higher scores on each of these indicate higher levels of working memory. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."

NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Episodic Memory (Picture Sequence Memory),PicSeq_AgeAdj,"The Picture Sequence Memory Test is an assessment of episodic memory for ages 3-85 years which involves the acquisition, storage and effortful recall of new information. It is considered a strong 'fluid ability' measure, with performance reaching a peak in early adulthood and declining across the life span. It involves recalling increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.

The participant is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographic images on the computer screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. Higher scores indicate higher vocabulary ability. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.

NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,Cognition,Processing Speed (Pattern Completion Processing Speed),ProcSpeed_AgeAdj,"The Pattern Comparison Processing Test is a measure of speed of processing, which is considered a 'fluid ability' because it steadily improves (time to complete task decreases) throughout childhood and adolescence, then begins to decline in adulthood. This test for ages 7-85 asks participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not. The items are designed to be simple to most purely measure processing speed. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.
