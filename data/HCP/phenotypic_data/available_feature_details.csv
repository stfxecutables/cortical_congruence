cardsort_ageadj,cognition,reg,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. DCCS is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.

flanker_ageadj,cognition,reg,"The Flanker is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention for ages 3-85. It is considered a fluid ability measure (i.e. measures the capacity for new learning and information processing in novel situations) in which performance reaches a peak in early adulthood, then tends to decline across the life span. The test requires the participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows for ages 8-85) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the flankers (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.",NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score

noise_comp,book_keeping,bin,"This test measures a person’s ability to recognize single words presented amid varying levels of background noise. It measures how much difficulty a person might have hearing in a noisy environment. A percent correct is calculated, which is then translated into a threshold score for each ear, in decibels of signal-to-noise ratio (dB S/N), using a look-up table. The range of possible scores for each ear is -2.0 to 26.0 dB S/N, with lower scores indicative of better performance and, conversely, higher scores potentially suggestive of hearing difficulties. Note: HCP has used two versions of the NIH Toolbox WIN test (V1 and V2). In V1 the audio output was through a sound card and equalizer that is no longer supported and in V2 the audio output goes straight through the headphone jack worn by the participant. HCP switched from V1 to V2 WIN on January 23, 2015, so all Q1-S500 Subjects were administered V1 and most S900+ Subjects were administered V2.",NIH Toolbox Words-In-Noise Age 6+: Computed Score

It assesses respondents' sense of global self-efficacy (a person’s belief in his/her capacity to manage functioning and have control over meaningful events). The Unadjusted Scale Score has a Mean of 50, SD of 10. Higher scores are indicative of more general self-efficacy. Scores 1 SD or more below the mean (T ≤ 40) suggest low levels of general self-efficacy and scores 1 SD or more above the mean (T ≥ 60) suggest high levels of general self-efficacy.",NIH Toolbox Self-Efficacy Survey: Unadjusted Scale Score
