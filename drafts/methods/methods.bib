Samples of isolated bovine cranial pia mater were subjected to quasistatic traction to evaluate its tensile strength. The experimental curves of physiological deformation that were obtained can be subdivided into three parts that represent different mechanical properties: the nonlinear initial part of the curve demonstrates increasing stiffness, followed by a quasilinear pattern of elastic behavior, and finally a negative relationship (slope) between force and elongation, which characterizes a progressive deterioration. These three steps precede final sample rupture. The stiffness of the pia mater was calculated for both the initial and the linear (elastic) parts of the mean curve. The initial part and the elastic part of the curve show a typical stiffness value of 0.024 N/mm and 0.19 N/mm, respectively. The maximal mean force and corresponding maximal deformation that were attained were 1.1 N and 0.19, respectively.                                         Conclusions.               Although very thin and apparently fragile, pia mater exhibits an unexpectedly high level of stiffness and should have a significant influence on total brain mechanical properties in response to loading.}

  abstract = {Objective: Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have shown reduced cortical thickness (CT) in individuals with ADHD, but this abnormality disappears with age, suggesting developmental delay. However, cross-sectional MRI studies have shown reduced CT, suggesting abnormal development. The aim of this study was to compare whole-brain CT in male and female children, adolescents, and adults with ADHD with whole-brain CT in matched control participants. Method: MRI scans were performed on ADHD and control participants. Results: CT data revealed differences in right hemisphere (RH) only. Reduced CT was observed predominantly in the frontoparietal region. However, increased CT was observed predominantly in the occipital lobe. The CT differences were correlated with severity of ADHD. Analysis of sex differences revealed that location, number, and magnitude of CT differences were different between males and females in each age group. Conclusion: These data support the hypothesis that anatomical abnormalities in ADHD represent abnormal development rather than developmental delay.},

  abstract = {We introduce the independent factor analysis (IFA) method for recovering independent hidden sources from their observed mixtures. IFA generalizes and unifies ordinary factor analysis (FA), principal component analysis (PCA), and independent component analysis (ICA), and can handle not only square noiseless mixing but also the general case where the number of mixtures differs from the number of sources and the data are noisy. IFA is a two-step procedure. In the first step, the source densities, mixing matrix, and noise covariance are estimated from the observed data by maximum likelihood. For this purpose we present an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, which performs unsupervised learning of an associated probabilistic model of the mixing situation. Each source in our model is described by a mixture of gaussians; thus, all the probabilistic calculations can be performed analytically. In the second step, the sources are reconstructed from the observed data by an optimal nonlinear estimator. A variational approximation of this algorithm is derived for cases with a large number of sources, where the exact algorithm becomes intractable. Our IFA algorithm reduces to the one for ordinary FA when the sources become gaussian, and to an EM algorithm for PCA in the zero-noise limit. We derive an additional EM algorithm specifically for noiseless IFA. This algorithm is shown to be superior to ICA since it can learn arbitrary source densities from the data. Beyond blind separation, IFA can be used for modeling multidimensional data by a highly constrained mixture of gaussians and as a tool for nonlinear signal encoding.},

  abstract = {Regulation of emotional behavior is essential for human social interactions. Recent work has exposed its cognitive complexity, as well as its unexpected reliance on portions of the anterior PFC (aPFC) also involved in exploration, relational reasoning, and counterfactual choice, rather than on dorsolateral and medial prefrontal areas involved in several forms of cognitive control. This study anatomically qualifies the contribution of aPFC territories to the regulation of prepotent approach–avoidance action tendencies elicited by emotional faces, and explores a possible structural pathway through which this emotional action regulation might be implemented. We provide converging evidence from task-based fMRI, diffusion-weighted imaging, and functional connectivity fingerprints for a novel neural element in emotional regulation. Task-based fMRI in human male participants (               N               = 40) performing an emotional approach–avoidance task identified aPFC territories involved in the regulation of action tendencies elicited by emotional faces. Connectivity fingerprints, based on diffusion-weighted imaging and resting-state connectivity, localized those task-defined frontal regions to the lateral frontal pole (FPl), an anatomically defined portion of the aPFC that lacks a homologous counterpart in macaque brains. Probabilistic tractography indicated that 10\%–20\% of interindividual variation in emotional regulation abilities is accounted for by the strength of structural connectivity between FPl and amygdala. Evidence from an independent replication sample (               N               = 50; 10 females) further substantiated this result. These findings provide novel neuroanatomical evidence for incorporating FPl in models of control over human action tendencies elicited by emotional faces.                                         SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT               Successful regulation of emotional behaviors is a prerequisite for successful participation in human society, as is evidenced by the social isolation and loss of occupational opportunities often encountered by people suffering from emotion regulation disorders, such as social-anxiety disorder and psychopathy. Knowledge about the precise cortical regions and connections supporting this control is crucial for understanding both the nature of computations needed to successfully traverse the space of possible actions in social situations, and the potential interventions that might result in efficient treatment of social-emotional disorders. This study provides evidence for a precise cortical region (lateral frontal pole) and a structural pathway (the ventral amygdalofugal bundle) through which a cognitively complex form of emotional action regulation might be implemented in the human brain.},

The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) is a self-rated questionnaire which assesses sleep quality and disturbances over a 1-month time interval. Nineteen individual items generate seven "component" scores: subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleeping medication, and daytime dysfunction. The sum of scores for these seven components yields one global score. Clinical and clinimetric properties of the PSQI were assessed over an 18-month period with "good" sleepers (healthy subjects, n = 52) and "poor" sleepers (depressed patients, n = 54; sleep-disorder patients, n = 62). Acceptable measures of internal homogeneity, consistency (test-retest reliability), and validity were obtained. A global PSQI score greater than 5 yielded a diagnostic sensitivity of 89.6\% and specificity of 86.5\% (kappa = 0.75, p less than 0.001) in distinguishing good and poor sleepers. The clinimetric and clinical properties of the PSQI suggest its utility both in psychiatric clinical practice and research activities.},

  abstract = {An integrated framework for density-based cluster analysis, outlier detection, and data visualization is introduced in this article. The main module consists of an algorithm to compute hierarchical estimates of the level sets of a density, following Hartigan’s classic model of density-contour clusters and trees. Such an algorithm generalizes and improves existing density-based clustering techniques with respect to different aspects. It provides as a result a complete clustering hierarchy composed of all possible density-based clusters following the nonparametric model adopted, for an infinite range of density thresholds. The resulting hierarchy can be easily processed so as to provide multiple ways for data visualization and exploration. It can also be further postprocessed so that: (i) a normalized score of “outlierness” can be assigned to each data object, which unifies both the global and local perspectives of outliers into a single definition; and (ii) a “flat” (i.e., nonhierarchical) clustering solution composed of clusters extracted from local cuts through the cluster tree (possibly corresponding to different density thresholds) can be obtained, either in an unsupervised or in a semisupervised way. In the unsupervised scenario, the algorithm corresponding to this postprocessing module provides a global, optimal solution to the formal problem of maximizing the overall stability of the extracted clusters. If partially labeled objects or instance-level constraints are provided by the user, the algorithm can solve the problem by considering both constraints violations/satisfactions and cluster stability criteria. An asymptotic complexity analysis, both in terms of running time and memory space, is described. Experiments are reported that involve a variety of synthetic and real datasets, including comparisons with state-of-the-art, density-based clustering and (global and local) outlier detection methods.},

Previous explanations have suggested that this intriguing, seemingly wasteful phenomenon is utilized to remove “erroneous” synapses. We prove that this interpretation is wrong if synapses are Hebbian. Under limited metabolic energy resources restricting the amount and strength of synapses, we show that memory performance is maximized if synapses are first overgrown and then pruned following optimal “minimal-value” deletion. This optimal strategy leads to interesting insights concerning childhood amnesia.},

The maths involved in the technique can be very complex and offputting, and many of those brought into contact with it are desperate for a simple introduction. This book fills that need, and already has a reputation for doing so. This new edition incorporates fundamental help in the use of factor and cluster analysis computer programs within the statistical package SPSS.

  abstract = {Cortical thickness varies throughout the cortex in a systematic way. However, it is challenging to investigate the patterns of cortical thickness due to the intricate geometry of the cortex. The cortex has a folded nature both in radial and tangential directions which forms not only gyri and sulci but also tangential folds and intersections. In this article, cortical curvature and depth are used to characterize the spatial distribution of the cortical thickness with much higher resolution than conventional regional atlases. To do this, a computational pipeline was developed that is capable of calculating a variety of quantitative measures such as surface area, cortical thickness, curvature (mean curvature, Gaussian curvature, shape index, intrinsic curvature index, and folding index), and sulcal depth. By analyzing 501 neurotypical adult human subjects from the ABIDE‐I dataset, we show that cortex has a very organized structure and cortical thickness is strongly correlated with local shape. Our results indicate that cortical thickness consistently increases along the gyral–sulcal spectrum from concave to convex shape, encompassing the saddle shape along the way. Additionally, tangential folds influence cortical thickness in a similar way as gyral and sulcal folds; outer folds are consistently thicker than inner., Cortical thickness varies throughout the cortex in a systematic way. In this article, we developed an open‐source computational pipeline that is capable of calculating a variety of quantitative surface measures, to characterize the spatial distribution of the cortical thickness.

  abstract = {In this study, we have assessed the validity and reliability of an automated labeling system that we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex on magnetic resonance images into gyral based regions of interest (ROIs). Using a dataset of 40 MRI scans we manually identified 34 cortical ROIs in each of the individual hemispheres. This information was then encoded in the form of an atlas that was utilized to automatically label ROIs. To examine the validity, as well as the intra- and inter-rater reliability of the automated system, we used both intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and a new method known as mean distance maps, to assess the degree of mismatch between the manual and the automated sets of ROIs. When compared with the manual ROIs, the automated ROIs were highly accurate, with an average ICC of 0.835 across all of the ROIs, and a mean distance error of less than 1 mm. Intra- and inter-rater comparisons yielded little to no difference between the sets of ROIs. These findings suggest that the automated method we have developed for subdividing the human cerebral cortex into standard gyral-based neuroanatomical regions is both anatomically valid and reliable. This method may be useful for both morphometric and functional studies of the cerebral cortex as well as for clinical investigations aimed at tracking the evolution of disease-induced changes over time, including clinical trials in which MRI-based measures are used to examine response to treatment.},

  abstract = {The paper surveys over twenty models of delay discounting (also known as temporal discounting, time preference, time discounting), that psychologists and economists have put forward to explain the way people actually trade off time and money. Using little more than the basic algebra of powers and logarithms, I show how the models are derived, what assumptions they are based upon, and how different models relate to each other. Rather than concentrate only on discount functions themselves, I show how discount functions may be manipulated to isolate rate parameters for each model. This approach, consistently applied, helps focus attention on the three main components in any discounting model: subjectively perceived money; subjectively perceived time; and how these elements are combined. We group models by the number of parameters that have to be estimated, which means our exposition follows a trajectory of increasing complexity to the models. However, as the story unfolds it becomes clear that most models fall into a smaller number of families. We also show how new models may be constructed by combining elements of different models. The surveyed models are: Exponential; Hyperbolic; Arithmetic; Hyperboloid (Green \& Myerson, Rachlin); Loewenstein and Prelec Generalized Hyperboloid; quasi-Hyperbolic (also known as β-δ discounting); Benhabib et al’s fixed cost; Benhabib et al’s Exponential / Hyperbolic / quasi-Hyperbolic; Read’s discounting fractions; Roelofsma’s exponential time; Scholten and Read’s discounting-by-intervals (DBI); Ebert and Prelec’s constant sensitivity (CS); Bleichrodt et al.’s constant absolute decreasing impatience (CADI); Bleichrodt et al.’s constant relative decreasing impatience (CRDI); Green, Myerson, and Macaux’s hyperboloid over intervals models; Killeen’s additive utility; size-sensitive additive utility; Yi, Landes, and Bickel’s memory trace models; McClure et al.’s two exponentials; and Scholten and Read’s trade-off model. For a convenient overview, a single “cheat sheet” table captures the notation and essential mathematics behind all but one of the models.},

  abstract = {In recent years, exploration of the developing brain has become a major focus for researchers and clinicians in an attempt to understand what allows children to acquire amazing and unique abilities, as well as the impact of early disruptions (eg, prematurity, neonatal insults) that can lead to a wide range of neurodevelopmental disorders. Noninvasive neuroimaging methods such as MRI are essential to establish links between the brain and behavioral changes in newborns and infants. In this review article, we aim to highlight recent and representative studies using the various techniques available: anatomical MRI, quantitative MRI (relaxometry, diffusion MRI), multiparametric approaches, and functional MRI. Today, protocols use 1.5 or 3T MRI scanners, and specialized methodologies have been put in place for data acquisition and processing to address the methodological challenges specific to this population, such as sensitivity to motion. MR sequences must be adapted to the brains of newborns and infants to obtain relevant good soft‐tissue contrast, given the small size of the cerebral structures and the incomplete maturation of tissues. The use of age‐specific image postprocessing tools is also essential, as signal and contrast differ from the adult brain. Appropriate methodologies then make it possible to explore multiple neurodevelopmental mechanisms in a precise way, and assess changes with age or differences between groups of subjects, particularly through large‐scale projects. Although MRI measurements only indirectly reflect the complex series of dynamic processes observed throughout development at the molecular and cellular levels, this technique can provide information on brain morphology, structural connectivity, microstructural properties of gray and white matter, and on the functional architecture. Finally, MRI measures related to clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological markers have a key role to play from a diagnostic and prognostic perspective in the implementation of early interventions to avoid long‐term disabilities in children.

  abstract = {Accurate and automated methods for measuring the thickness of human cerebral cortex could provide powerful tools for diagnosing and studying a variety of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. Manual methods for estimating cortical thickness from neuroimaging data are labor intensive, requiring several days of effort by a trained anatomist. Furthermore, the highly folded nature of the cortex is problematic for manual techniques, frequently resulting in measurement errors in regions in which the cortical surface is not perpendicular to any of the cardinal axes. As a consequence, it has been impractical to obtain accurate thickness estimates for the entire cortex in individual subjects, or group statistics for patient or control populations. Here, we present an automated method for accurately measuring the thickness of the cerebral cortex across the entire brain and for generating cross-subject statistics in a coordinate system based on cortical anatomy. The intersubject standard deviation of the thickness measures is shown to be less than 0.5 mm, implying the ability to detect focal atrophy in small populations or even individual subjects. The reliability and accuracy of this new method are assessed by within-subject test–retest studies, as well as by comparison of cross-subject regional thickness measures with published values.},

  abstract = {Abstract             A number of neuroimaging studies have implicated an involvement of Broca's area, particularly of the pars opercularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), in the processing of complex (permuted) sentences. However, functional interpretations of this region's role range from very general (e.g., in terms of working memory) to highly specific (e.g., as supporting particular types of syntactic operations). A dissociation of these competing accounts is often impossible because in most cases, the language internal complexity of permuted sentence structures is accompanied invariably by increasing costs of a more general cognitive nature (e.g., working memory, task difficulty, and acceptability). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the precise nature of the pars opercularis activation in the processing of permuted sentences by examining the permutation of pronouns in German. Although clearly involving a permutation operation, sentences with an initial object pronoun behave like simple, subject‐initial sentences (e.g., in terms of acceptability) because of a rule stating that pronouns should generally precede non‐pronominal arguments. The results of the experiment show that in contrast to non‐pronominal permutations, sentences with a permuted pronoun do not engender enhanced pars opercularis activation. Our findings therefore speak against both language‐related working memory and transformation‐based accounts of this region's role in sentence comprehension. Rather, we argue that the pars opercularis of the left IFG supports the language‐specific linearization of hierarchical linguistic dependencies. Hum Brain Mapp, 2005. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.},

Hippocampal volume reduction is now one of the most consistent structural abnormalities found in schizophrenia: it is present at the onset of the illness and, to a lesser degree, in first‐degree relatives of schizophrenic probands. Decreased levels of N‐acetyl‐aspartate point towards a cellular basis of such volume changes. Functional neuroimaging studies have demonstrated abnormal levels of hippocampal activity at rest, during the experience of auditory hallucinations, and during the performance of memory retrieval tasks. These results of neuroimaging studies complement evidence from post‐mortem and behavioral studies, which have found regionally specific abnormalities of the hippocampus and of memory function in schizophrenia.

One of the successful applications is neurobiological data analysis such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and magnetoencephalography (MEG). However, many problems remain. In most cases, neurobiological data contain a lot of sensor noise, and the number of independent components is unknown. In this article, we discuss an approach to separate noise-contaminated data without knowing the number of independent components. A well-known two stage approach to ICA is to pre-process the data by principal component analysis (PCA), and then the necessary rotation matrix is estimated. Since PCA does not work well for noisy data, we implement a factor analysis model for pre-processing. In the new pre-processing, the number of sources and the amount of sensor noise are estimated. After the pre-processing, the rotation matrix is estimated using an ICA method. Through the experiments with MEG data, we show this approach is effective.},

Cortical structure was estimated with several measures (cortical volume, surface area, and thickness, sulcal depth, and absolute mean curvature in sulcal regions and sulcal walls) using three-dimensional surface-based methods in 148 normal subjects (n [men/women]: 83/65, age [mean ± standard deviation]: 25.0 ± 4.9 years). We found significantly larger scaling exponents than geometrically predicted for cortical surface area, absolute mean curvature in sulcal regions and in sulcal walls, and smaller ones for cortical volume and thickness. As brain size increases, the cortex thickens only slightly, but the degree of sulcal convolution increases dramatically, indicating that human cortices are not simply scaled versions of one another. Our results are consistent with previous hypotheses that greater local clustering of interneuronal connections would be required in a larger brain, and fiber tension between local cortical areas would induce cortical folds. We suggest that sex effects are explained by brain size effects in cortical structure at a macroscopic and lobar regional level, and that it is necessary to consider true relationships between cortical measures and brain size due to the limitations of linear stereotaxic normalization.},

We linked the concept of plausibility used in VR research with congruence-based modulation by assessing brain responses while participants experienced vehicle riding experiences in VR scenarios. Perceptual plausibility was manipulated by sensory congruence, with multisensory stimulations confirming with common expectations of road scenes being plausible. We hypothesized that plausible scenarios would elicit greater cortical responses. The results showed that: (i) vibrotactile stimulations at expected intensities, given embedded audio-visual information, engaged greater cortical activities in frontal and sensorimotor regions; (ii) weaker plausible stimulations resulted in greater responses in the sensorimotor cortex than stronger but implausible stimulations; (iii) frontal activities under plausible scenarios negatively correlated with plausibility violation costs in the sensorimotor cortex. These results potentially indicate frontal regulation of sensory processing and extend previous evidence of contextual modulation to the tactile sense.},

Objectives               To investigate the clinical presentation of multiple sclerosis in a large‐scale MRI analysis that includes thorough consideration of extractable structural measurements (average and variability of regional cortical thicknesses, cortical surface measurements, and volumes).                                         Methods               We performed a large‐scale retrospective analysis of 370 T1 structural volumetric MRIs from 64 participants with multiple sclerosis and compared them with a large cohort of neurotypical participants, consisting of 993 MRIs from 988 participants. Regionally distributed measurements of cortical thickness (average and standard deviation) were extracted along with surface area, surface curvature, and volumetric measurements.                                         Results               The largest observed finding involved regionally distributed reductions in average cortical thickness, with the parahippocampal region exhibiting the largest effect size, a finding that may be linked with known hippocampal atrophy in multiple sclerosis. Group‐wise differences were also observed in terms of distributed volume, surface area, and surface curvature measurements.

Statistical and computational methods were used to compare participants with ADHD and neurotypical controls at a variety of developmental stages to assess detectable abnormal neurodevelopment potentially associated with ADHD and to assess our ability to diagnose and characterise the condition from real‐world clinical MRI examinations. T1‐weighted structural MRI examinations (               n\,=               ~993; 0–31\,years old [YO]) were obtained from neurotypical controls, and 637 examinations were obtained from patients with ADHD (0–26 YO). Measures of average (mean) regional cortical thickness were acquired, alongside the first reporting of regional cortical thickness variability (as assessed with the standard deviation [SD]) in ADHD. A comparison between the inattentive and combined (inattentive and hyperactive) subtypes of ADHD is also provided. A preliminary independent validation was also performed on the publicly available ADHD200 dataset. Relative to controls, subjects with ADHD had, on average, lowered SD of cortical thicknesses and increased mean thicknesses across several key regions potentially linked with known symptoms of ADHD, including the precuneus and supramarginal gyrus.},

Our analysis includes the use of publicly available automated extraction tools to assess regional cortical thickness (inclusive of within region cortical thickness variability) from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), to characterize group-wise abnormalities associated with schizophrenia based on a publicly available dataset. We have also performed a correlation analysis between the automatically extracted biomarkers and a variety of patient clinical variables available. Finally, we also present the results of a machine learning analysis. Results demonstrate regional cortical thickness abnormalities in schizophrenia. We observed a correlation (rho = 0.474) between patients’ depression and the average cortical thickness of the right medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our leading machine learning technology evaluated was the support vector machine with stepwise feature selection, yielding a sensitivity of 92\% and a specificity of 74\%, based on regional brain measurements, including from the insula, superior frontal, caudate, calcarine sulcus, gyrus rectus, and rostral middle frontal regions. These results imply that advanced analytic techniques combining MRI with automated biomarker extraction can be helpful in characterizing patients with schizophrenia.},

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides excellent soft‐tissue contrast, which allows for the assessment of gray and white matter in the developing brain. We performed a large‐scale retrospective analysis of 993 pediatric structural brain MRI examinations of healthy subjects (               n               \,=\,988, aged 0–32 years) imaged clinically at 3 T, and extracted a wide variety of measurements such as white matter volumes, cortical thickness, and gyral curvature localized to subregions of the brain. All extracted structural biomarkers were tested for their correlation with subject age at time of imaging, providing measurements that may assist in the assessment of neurological maturation. Additional analyses were also performed to assess gender‐based differences in the brain at a variety of developmental stages, and to assess hemispheric asymmetries. Results add to the literature by analyzing a realistic distribution of healthy participants imaged clinically, a useful cohort toward the investigation and creation of diagnostic tests for a variety of pathologies as aberrations from healthy growth trajectories. The next generation of diagnostic tests will be responsible for identifying pathological conditions from populations of healthy clinically imaged individuals.

  abstract = {Abstract             Neurodevelopmental disorders, such as attention‐deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), are often accompanied by disrupted cortical folding. We applied a quantitative sulcal pattern analysis technique using graph structures to study the atypical cortical folding at the lobar level in ADHD brains in this study. A total of 183 ADHD patients and 167 typical developmental controls matched according to age and gender were enrolled. We first constructed sulcal graphs at the brain lobar level and then investigated their similarity to the typical sulcal patterns. The within‐group variability and interhemispheric similarity in sulcal patterns were also compared between the ADHD and TDC groups. The results showed that, compared with controls, the left frontal, right parietal, and temporal lobes displayed altered similarities to the typical sulcal patterns in patients with ADHD. Moreover, the sulcal patterns in ADHD seem to be more heterogeneous than those in controls. The results also identified the disruption of the typical asymmetric sulcal patterns in the frontal lobe between the ADHD and control groups. Taken together, our results revealed the atypical sulcal pattern in boys with ADHD and provide new insights into the neuroanatomical mechanisms of ADHD.},

Cortical folds develop in a time-locked fashion during fetal growth. We leveraged this temporal specificity of sulcation to investigate the timing of the prenatal insult linked to schizophrenia and the cognitive impairment seen in this illness.                                         Methods               Anatomical MRI scans from 68 patients with schizophrenia and 72 controls were used to evaluate the sulcal depth of five major invariable primary sulci representing lobar development (calcarine sulcus, superior temporal sulcus, superior frontal sulcus, intraparietal sulcus and inferior frontal sulcus) with formation representing the distinct developmental periods.                                         Results                                A repeated-measure ANOVA with five sulci and two hemispheres as the within-subject factors and gender, age and intracranial volume as covariates revealed a significant effect of diagnosis (                 F                 [1,134] = 14.8,                 p                 = 0.0002).

Conclusion               Our results suggest that the gestational disruption underlying schizophrenia is likely to predate, if not coincide with the appearance of calcarine sulcus (early second trimester). Nevertheless, the burden of cognitive deficits may relate specifically to the aberrant superior frontal development apparent in late second trimester.},

  abstract = {HDBSCAN is a density-based clustering algorithm that constructs a cluster hierarchy tree and then uses a specific stability measure to extract flat clusters from the tree. We show how the application of an additional threshold value can result in a combination of DBSCAN* and HDBSCAN clusters, and demonstrate potential benefits of this hybrid approach when clustering data of variable densities. In particular, our approach is useful in scenarios where we require a low minimum cluster size but want to avoid an abundance of micro-clusters in high-density regions. The method can directly be applied to HDBSCAN's tree of cluster candidates and does not require any modifications to the hierarchy itself. It can easily be integrated as an addition to existing HDBSCAN implementations.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has transformed our understanding of the human brain through well-replicated mapping of abilities to specific structures (for example, lesion studies) and functions               1–3               (for example, task functional MRI (fMRI)). Mental health research and care have yet to realize similar advances from MRI. A primary challenge has been replicating associations between inter-individual differences in brain structure~or~function and complex cognitive or mental health phenotypes (brain-wide association studies (BWAS)). Such BWAS have typically relied on sample sizes appropriate for classical brain mapping               4               (the median neuroimaging study sample size is about 25), but potentially too small for capturing reproducible brain–behavioural phenotype associations               5,6               . Here we used three of the largest neuroimaging datasets currently available—with a total sample size of around 50,000 individuals—to quantify BWAS effect sizes and reproducibility as a function of sample size. BWAS associations were smaller than previously thought, resulting in statistically underpowered studies, inflated effect sizes and replication failures at typical sample sizes. As sample sizes grew into the thousands, replication rates began to improve and effect size inflation decreased. More robust BWAS effects were detected for functional MRI (versus structural), cognitive tests (versus mental health questionnaires) and multivariate methods (versus univariate). Smaller than expected brain–phenotype associations and variability across population subsamples can explain widespread BWAS replication failures. In contrast to non-BWAS approaches with larger effects (for example, lesions, interventions and within-person), BWAS reproducibility requires samples with thousands of individuals.},

  abstract = {Factor Analysis is a genetic term for a somewhat vaguely delimited set of techniques for data processing, mainly applicable to the social and biological sciences. These techniques have been developed for the analysis of mutual relationships among a number of measurements made on a number of measurable entities. In the broad sense, factor analysis comprises a number of statistical models which yield testable hypotheses -- hypotheses that may confirm or disconfirm in terms of the usual statistical procedures for making tests of significance. It also comprises a number of simplifying procedures for the approximate description of data, which do not in any sense constitute disconfirmable hypotheses, except in the loose sense that they supply approximations to the data. In literature, the two types of analysis have often been confused.   This book clarifies the concepts of factor analysis for students or professionals in the social sciences who wish to know the technique, rather than the mathematics, of factor theory. Mathematical concepts are described to have an intuitive meaning for the non-mathematical reader. An account of the elements of matrix algebra, in the appendix, and the (mathematical) notes following each chapter will help the reader who wishes to receive a more advanced treatment of the subject. Factor Analysis and Related Methods should prove a useful text for graduate and advanced undergraduate students in economics, the behavioral sciences, and education. Researchers and practitioners in those fields will also find this book a handy reference.},

  abstract = {Object.               The pia mater has received little attention regarding its function in the deformation of the spinal cord under compression. In this study the mechanical properties and function of the spinal pia mater were investigated using three methods.                                         Methods.               Spinal cord segments were excised from rabbits. The elastic modulus of the pia mater was measured by performing a tensile test using specimens with the pia mater intact and ones with the pia mater stripped off. The stiffness of the spinal cord was examined by performing a compression test with specimens containing an intact pia mater and ones with a pia mater that was incised at both sides. The cross-sectional area and circumference of the spinal cord were measured on axial views of magnetic resonance images in patients with cervical disc herniations before and after surgery.                          The pia mater had an elastic modulus of 2300 kPa, which was 460 times higher than that of spinal cord parenchyma. By covering the parenchyma, it tripled the overall elastic modulus of the spinal cord. The pia mater increased the stiffness of the spinal cord and enhanced its shape recovery after removal of the compression. The cross-sectional area of the spinal cord increased after surgery, whereas the circumference of the spinal cord changed little.                            Conclusions.               The pia mater firmly covers the spinal cord and has a high elastic modulus; it therefore provides a constraint on the spinal cord surface. It prevents elongation of the circumference and produces a large strain energy that is responsible for shape restoration following decompression.}

However, although microglia have been shown to engulf and clear damaged cellular debris after brain insult, it remains less clear what role microglia play in the uninjured brain. Here, we show that microglia actively engulf synaptic material and play a major role in synaptic pruning during postnatal development in mice. These findings link microglia surveillance to synaptic maturation and suggest that deficits in microglia function may contribute to synaptic abnormalities seen in some neurodevelopmental disorders.},

  abstract = {The rise in Infantile Autism, learning problems, cognitive decline with age, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's Diseases and the SIDS epidemic, has a common cause in the rising dietary deficit in Omega-3 brain-food.             This paper suggests that aside from the wider concept of Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Pervasive Developmental Disorders (PDD), the rise in Infantile Autism (IA) in the last decade is the effect of deficient brain-food (Omega-3). The consequent delay of development, prolongs the 2nd regressive event in infancy to pruning of the centre in the Medial Frontal Lobe System that connects Hippocampus and Singulum. With a consequently defective Supplementary Motor Area (SMA), the Delayed Response Function is affected leading to persistent psychosis. Post-Pubertal Episodic Psychoses are associated with acute reduction of excitation, a risk of breakdown of circuitry, insufficient fill-in mechanisms, and silent spots. An acute psychosis occurs if the silent spots compromise SMA. Only two brain areas have continuous neurogenesis, indicating their important functions: the Hippocampus and Olfactory Bulb that belongs to the Lateral Frontal Lobe System essential to survival. Concerned with necessity of action in response to the environment, it relies upon short-term memory and Acute Feedback Mechanisms influenced by emotion and motivation from the external world. In contrast, the Medial Frontal Lobe network is controlled by Feed-Forward Predictive Mechanisms related to storage of information The Delayed Response Function is mastered at 7 months, when 2nd event occurs with pruning of axons and dendrites. An abolished or defective Delayed Response Function seriously incapacitates an individual: A defective “Social Brain” with an inability for conscious action and to communicate, predominates in IA. There is a near lack of speech, despite normal vision and hearing in the minority without marked adversity in pregnancy, at delivery or in infancy.             The recent rise in IA despite no rise in adversity signifies a rising deficiency in brain-food. This is suggested by a changing clinical picture: no Mental Retardation in an IA majority. Deficit in Olfaction is pathognomonic in schizophrenia since 30yrs and distinguishes the Asperger Syndrome. If brain-food deficiency alone sufficiently prolongs pruning to cause absent activity in SMA in infancy, less mentally retarded IA from other causes might be observed. Deficit in brain-food was evident in the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome: birthweight averaged 200–300g lower than sibs, Omega-3 levels in brainstem were lower than controls. Only 20\% SIDS died in first hypoxic episode, suggesting such episodes are more frequent than we imagined. Children with learning-behaviour problems have similarly depressed birthweight. A general deficiency in Omega-3 contributes to the lacking reduction in Schizophrenia, despite early puberty predominates. Olfactory Bulb is first affected in the Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Cognitive decline with age, hippocampal dysfunctions rises markedly irrespective of disease, but the major mental illnesses and Infantile Autism in particular, benefit from “brain-food” that might also prevent a development of these disorders. To secure optimal brain function in the coming generations, there is a need to change the diet now from its emphasis on protein for body growth to food for the brain. This means there is a need to increase fish and sea food consumption.},

  abstract = {There is controversy over the nature of the disturbance in brain development that underpins attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). In particular, it is unclear whether the disorder results from a delay in brain maturation or whether it represents a complete deviation from the template of typical development. Using computational neuroanatomic techniques, we estimated cortical thickness at {$>$}40,000 cerebral points from 824 magnetic resonance scans acquired prospectively on 223 children with ADHD and 223 typically developing controls. With this sample size, we could define the growth trajectory of each cortical point, delineating a phase of childhood increase followed by adolescent decrease in cortical thickness (a quadratic growth model). From these trajectories, the age of attaining peak cortical thickness was derived and used as an index of cortical maturation. We found maturation to progress in a similar manner regionally in both children with and without ADHD, with primary sensory areas attaining peak cortical thickness before polymodal, high-order association areas. However, there was a marked delay in ADHD in attaining peak thickness throughout most of the cerebrum: the median age by which 50\% of the cortical points attained peak thickness for this group was 10.5 years (SE 0.01), which was significantly later than the median age of 7.5 years (SE 0.02) for typically developing controls (log rank test χ(               1               )               2               = 5,609,               P               {$<$} 1.0 × 10               −20               ). The delay was most prominent in prefrontal regions important for control of cognitive processes including attention and motor planning. Neuroanatomic documentation of a delay in regional cortical maturation in ADHD has not been previously reported.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Neurons in primary visual cortex are selective for stimulus orientation, and a neuron’s preferred orientation changes little when the stimulus is switched from one eye to the other. It has recently been shown that monocular orientation preferences are uncorrelated before eye opening; how, then, do they become aligned during visual experience? We aimed to provide a model for this acquired congruence. Our model, which simulates the cat’s visual system, comprises multiple on-centre and off-centre channels from both eyes converging onto neurons in primary visual cortex; development proceeds in two phases via Hebbian plasticity in the geniculocortical synapse. First, cortical drive comes from waves of activity drifting across each retina. The result is orientation tuning that differs between the two eyes. The second phase begins with eye opening: at each visual field location, on-centre cortical inputs from one eye can cancel off-centre inputs from the other eye. Synaptic plasticity reduces the destructive interference by up-regulating inputs from one eye at the expense of its fellow, resulting in binocular congruence of orientation tuning. We also show that orthogonal orientation preferences at the end of the first phase result in ocular dominance, suggesting that ocular dominance is a by-product of binocular congruence.},

  abstract = {Previous studies conducted by our group have provided  evidence for age-related reductions in cortical thickness  in dorsal frontal and parietal regions between childhood  and adulthood, and gray matter volume increases of mesial  temporal and anterior diencephalic structures. The purpose  of this study was to describe neurobehavioral correlates  of these brain maturational changes using morphometric  analyses of brain magnetic resonance images (MRI) and two  tests of cognitive abilities. Participants were 35 normal  children roughly stratified by age (7 to 16 years) and  sex (20 boys and 15 girls) and frontal and mesial temporal  regions were anatomically defined in each subjects'  MRI data. The California Verbal Learning Test–Children's  Version and the Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure test were  used as measures of verbal and visuospatial memory and  organizational abilities. Analyses designed to show regionally  specific relationships between the brain and behavioral  measures revealed interesting results. Specifically, frontal  lobe gray matter thinning was more strongly predictive  of delayed verbal memory functioning than was the mesial  temporal lobe gray matter volume, and this relationship  did not appear to be mediated by factors indexed in chronological  age. Similar, but less regionally specific relationships  were observed for measures of visuospatial memory abilities  and frontal lobe maturation. Functional imaging studies  in the literature consistently report activation in frontal  regions in adults during retrieval tasks. The relationship  between frontal lobe maturation and delayed recall observed  here may be reflective of the children's development  towards the more adult-like frontal lobe function revealed  in the functional imaging studies.

The hypothesis originates in a neurocomputational model of the regressive sub‐type (Thomas, Knowland \& Karmiloff‐Smith, 2011a, 2011b). Here we develop a more general version of the over‐pruning hypothesis to address heterogeneity in the timing of manifestation of               ASD               , including new computer simulations which reconcile the different observed developmental trajectories (early onset, late onset, regression) via a single underlying atypical mechanism; and which show how unaffected siblings of individuals with               ASD               may differ from controls either by inheriting a milder version of the pathological mechanism or by co‐inheriting the risk factors without the pathological mechanism. The proposed atypical mechanism involves overly aggressive synaptic pruning in infancy and early childhood, an exaggeration of a normal phase of brain development. We show how the hypothesis generates novel predictions that differ from existing theories of ASD including that (1) the first few months of development in               ASD               will be indistinguishable from typical, and (2) the earliest atypicalities in               ASD               will be sensory and motor rather than social. Both predictions gain cautious support from emerging longitudinal studies of infants at‐risk of               ASD               . We review evidence consistent with the over‐pruning hypothesis, its relation to other current theories (including C. Frith's under‐pruning proposal; C. Frith, 2003, 2004), as well as inconsistent data and current limitations. The hypothesis situates causal accounts of               ASD               within a framework of protective and risk factors (Newschaffer               et~al               ., 2012); clarifies different versions of the broader autism phenotype (i.e. the implication of observed similarities between individuals with autism and their family members); and integrates data from multiple disciplines, including behavioural studies, neuroscience studies, genetics, and intervention studies.},

Aims               This study compared the CThick–SDepth relationship in children with focal epilepsy with typically developing children (TDC) and the role played by seizure and psychopathology variables.                                         Method               A surface-based, computational high-resolution three-dimesional (3D) magnetic resonance image analytic technique compared regional CThick–SDepth relationships in 42 participants with focal epilepsy and 46 TDC (6–16 years) imaged in a 1.5 Tesla scanner. Psychiatric interviews administered to each participant yielded psychiatric diagnoses. Parents provided seizure-related information.                                         Results               The TDC group alone demonstrated a significant negative medial fronto-orbital CThick–SDepth correlation. Focal epilepsy participants with but not without psychiatric diagnoses showed significant positive pre-central and post-central CThick–SDepth associations not found in TDC. Although the history of prolonged seizures was significantly associated with the postcentral CThick–SDepth correlation, it was unrelated to the presence/absence of psychiatric diagnoses.                                         Conclusions               Abnormal CThick–SDepth pre-central and post-central associations might be a psychopathology biomarker in paediatric focal epilepsy.},

The total surface area of the reconstructed Visible Man neocortex is 1570 cm2(both hemispheres), ∼70\% of which is buried in sulci. By linking the Visible Man cerebrum to the Talairach stereotaxic coordinate space, the locations of activation foci reported in neuroimaging studies can be readily visualized in relation to the cortical surface. The associated spatial uncertainty was empirically shown to have a radius in three dimensions of ∼10 mm. Application of this approach to studies of visual cortex reveals the overall patterns of activation associated with different aspects of visual function and the relationship of these patterns to topographically organized visual areas. Our analysis supports a distinction between an anterior region in ventral occipito-temporal cortex that is selectively involved in form processing and a more posterior region (in or near areas VP and V4v) involved in both form and color processing. Foci associated with motion processing are mainly concentrated in a region along the occipito-temporal junction, the ventral portion of which overlaps with foci also implicated in form processing. Comparisons between flat maps of human and macaque monkey cerebral cortex indicate significant differences as well as many similarities in the relative sizes and positions of cortical regions known or suspected to be homologous in the two species.},

The neuronal mechanisms underlying behavioral congruency effects, however, are poorly understood. We recorded single unit activity in monkey prefrontal cortex using a task-switching paradigm and discovered a neuronal congruency effect (NCE) that is carried by target and distractor neurons which process target and distractor-related information, respectively. The former neurons provide more signal, the latter less noise in congruent compared to incongruent conditions, resulting in a better target representation. Such NCE is dominated by the level of congruency, and is not determined by the task rules the subjects used, their reaction times (RT), the length of the delay period, nor the response levels of the neurons. We propose that this NCE can explain behavioral congruency effects in general, as well as previous fMRI and EEG results in various conflict paradigms.},

Advanced analysis of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been used to find brain abnormalities and their relationship to neurocognitive impairments in children and adolescents with DS. Because genetic factors affect brain development in early fetal life, there is a growing interest in analyzing brains from living fetuses with DS. In this study, we investigated regional sulcal folding depth as well as global cortical gyrification from fetal brain MRIs. Nine fetuses with DS (29.1\,±\,4.24 gestational weeks [mean\,±\,standard deviation]) were compared with 17 typically developing [TD] fetuses (28.4\,±\,3.44). Fetuses with DS showed lower whole-brain average sulcal depths and gyrification index than TD fetuses. Significant decreases in sulcal depth were found in bilateral Sylvian fissures and right central and parieto-occipital sulci. On the other hand, significantly increased sulcal depth was shown in the left superior temporal sulcus, which is related to atypical hemispheric asymmetry of cortical folding. Moreover, these group differences increased as gestation progressed. This study demonstrates that regional sulcal depth is a sensitive marker for detecting alterations of cortical development in DS during fetal life, which may be associated with later neurocognitive impairment.},
